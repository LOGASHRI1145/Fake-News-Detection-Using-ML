# Fake-News-Detection-Using-ML
Project Description

This Fake News Detection project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify news articles as either real or fake. It involves preprocessing text data, extracting relevant features, and training various machine learning models to improve accuracy. The project is designed to help users and organizations filter out misinformation and ensure they consume credible news sources.

Key Components:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying tokenization.

Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF and Count Vectorization to transform text into numerical features.

Model Training: Implementing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User Interface: Providing a simple interface to input news articles and obtain predictions.
